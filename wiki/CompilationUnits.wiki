#summary The organization of a source file.
<wiki:toc max_depth="3"/>

= Compilation units =
A compilation unit represents the structure of a source file and is described by the root production of the grammar:
<em><pre>
compilation-unit:
    using-directives,,opt,, package-member-declarations,,opt,, 
    
package-member-declarations:
    package-member-declaration
    package-member-declarations package-member-declaration
    
package-member-declaration:
    package-declaration
    class-declaration
    interface-declaration
    enum-declaration
    delegate-declaration
</pre></em>
There is no restriction on the number of packages and types in a Stab source file.

= Package declarations =
A package declaration in Stab has a body delimited with { and }:
<em><pre>
package-declaration:
    annotations,,opt,, *package* qualified-identifier *{* using-directives,,opt,, package-member-declarations,,opt,, *} ;*,,opt,,
</pre></em>
Package declarations can be nested:
{{{
package A {
    package B {
        // Package members
    }
}
}}}
is equivalent to:
{{{
package A.B {
    // Package members
}
}}}
= Using directives =
Using directives are used to give access to the types declared in other packages without having to fully qualify their names.
<em><pre>
using-directives:
    using-directive
    using-directives using-directive
    
using-directive:
    using-alias-directive
    using-package-directive
</pre></em>
The directives in a single block are not affected by the other {{{using}}} directives:
{{{
package A {
    using java.lang;
    using C = String; // error: String is unknown
}
}}}
== Using alias directives ==
Using alias directives redefine a package or type name locally.
<em><pre>
using-alias-directive:
    *using* identifier = package-or-type-name ;
</pre></em>
Constructed generic types can be aliased:
{{{
using java.lang;
using java.util;
package A {
    using StringList = ArrayList<String>;
}
}}}

== Using package directives ==
Using package directives gives access to all the public types of a package by their simple names.
<em><pre>
using-alias-directive:
    *using* qualified-identifier ;
</pre></em>
