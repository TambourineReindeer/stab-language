#summary Adding a throws clause in the generated bytecode

= Checked exceptions =
In Stab the exceptions are not checked at compile-time. However the compiler generates a throws clause in the generated bytecode if a method is decorated with a {{{stab.lang.Throws}}} annotation.

It is useful for Java interoperability.
For example
{{{
using java.io;
using stab.lang;
class C {
    [Throws({ typeof(IOException) })]
    public int test(Reader r) {
        return r.read();
    }
}
}}}
makes it possible to catch the {{{IOException}}} in a Java program. Without the annotation it is not be possible to surround the call to the method with a try/catch statement.
